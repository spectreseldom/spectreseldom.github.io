	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/karthik-peravali/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/considered.html">Swift to C++ Converter</a></h1>
	<p>This idea has massive potential, converting swift, a medium fast language to C++, one of the fastest languages to exist. The Problem: Converting swift to C++ has things like classes that not every language has and unique things about each language. Swift has things like fast conversions between String, Integer, and Float, but other languages do not have this. The inverse is also true, C++ has ways to manipulate the computer memory itself, and swift does not. This idea could have potential, but it will be nearly impossible to make.</p>
	<br><h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aaron-berdecia/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">#2: Unnamed Zombie Horde Game</a></h1>
	<p>This idea will be fun to work on, and has considerable traction. However, with many of these ideas out here, this may not neccesarily be the best one.</p><br>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-liu/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">#3: Unnamed Rogue Like</a></h1>
	<p>This idea could succeed because rogue likes are fun to play and highly bought. However, to make a full, interactional game with a half decent story line can be hard. From experience last year, storylines come after you make everything else. This could be a punishing game, and whatnot, but there are too many factors for me to go with this idea.</p><br>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-bhuta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">#4: Tempora</a></h1>
	<p>Tempora: a game where the player time travels between levels, using that mechanic to finish them. With the storyline already planned out, this game will likely come to fruition. However, there are some other ideas that are inherently better.</p>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/devon-leerssen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">#5: Unnamed Circle Clicker</a></h1>
	<p>This game will most likely be easy to code, and therefore very polished. I doubt, however, that it will be able to attract an audience. A game where all you do is click circles is not an appealing game to the average consumer, and therefore will be likely to fail.</p>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/devon-leerssen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">#6: Unnamed Chatbot</a></h1>
	<p>A Chatbot is an interesting concepts, but actually coding it could be impossible. if they plan on making a chatbot like the psycotherapist ELIZA, this will be a worthless project, not worth pursing. On the other hand, making a chatbot with a neural network is nearly impossible. That could take years and a full team to make one capable of holding half a conversation.</p>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/eric-steiner/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">#7: Unnamed 2D Fighting Game</a></h1>
	<p> making a fighting game is interesting and could have good sales. However, fighting games are hard to make appealing to the consumer. Also, having other aspects in there could ultimately make this a lost cause, making those who like fighting games not purchase this. In the end, it won't work out.</p>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/robert-brugger/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">#8: Unnamed Strategy Game</a></h1>
	<p>Strategy games are fun and exiting for a certain audience. A Battle Royale mode is going above and beyond. If it were to be accomplished, it could be a great sale. However, it takes a massive amount of work to make a working strategy game. If working on the battle roayle mode is simultaneous, this is a monumental task. The idea has credit, but can't be done.</p>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zachary-chandler/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">#9: Untitled souls game</a></h1>
	<p>Souls games are hard to everyone that plays them. To make it accessible to everyone is an issue. Another issue it the fact that it needs to be 3D. These types of games are extremely hard to make, and will likely not be completed, the reason I do not accept.</p>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/soohan-cho/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">#10: Goooose Simulator</a></h1>
	<p>Similar to other games, this one will have the player going around with wanton destruction on their mind. The other players in the game will also compete, trying to help or fight the other players. This will be achievable because Roblox is the engine, with in-built currency and hosting. This idea is the most likely to succeed and the one I accept.</p>
