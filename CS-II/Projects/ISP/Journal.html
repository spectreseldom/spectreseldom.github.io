      <h3>Goals For This Week</h3>
      <p>A new major development happened this week. Our game, originally a roguelike with randomized rooms, has been converted to an arena shooter. This means we will not need to develop rooms, and can have a few arenas instead, and can make more mobs and weapons. This is good news, because the game is a lot more straightforward to make. It also means I can be a lot more helpful, because a lot of mobs will need to be done. This is what I am currently working on.</p>

      <h3>Tech Challenges</h3>
      <p>Originally, I was going to make a bunch of flowcharts in draw.io and import them to github. Unfortunately, I will not be able to do this since I do not have permission to CSAllenISD Github respository. I will need to figure out another way of doing this.</p><br><br> 
      <h3>Schedule Challenges</h3>
      <p>This week, I was not able to meet up with anyone outside of school. This was dissapointing, but not a total setback. I can overcome this and make sure I communicate this in our weekly meeting next week.</p><br>

      <h3>Tech Challenges</h3>
      <p>This week, we are learning to use blender. Blender is a 3d modeling system that we can transposition to roblox. This is important, because at the moment, we are making the weapons, rooms, and mobs.</p><br>
      <h3>Schelule Challenges</h3>
      <p>One of our team members does not come to meetings. This is especially challenging, because we all need to work together to complete this project. </p><br>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>Conflict over work needing to be done happened at meetings. We all got it figured out, and now for the week, we will have the final plan by the end of the week. My job is to work on the AI flowcharting system, to finish all of the basic mob AI.</p>

      <h3>Tech Challenges</h3>
      <p>This week, we have not been doing as much ISP because we have hard missions, like M2512, M2513, M2514. However, we still managed to work a little on the ISP.</p><br>
      <h3>Schelule Challenges</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, we don't have much time to work on the project. This can be hard, as we all need to pull our part to finish this. Also, w0.8e have missed many weekly meetings because some people in our team have cybersecurity.</p><br>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>We are not in regular contact with one of our team members. This is leading to a problem, as we need to all work together. We are currently working on a solution for this, trying to contact them more regularly.</p>

      <h1>13-Mar-2023</h1><br><br>
      <h3>Tech Challenges</h3>
      <p>This week, room design is a big thing. The in-build Roblox textures simply aren't good enough. We are starting to import 3D models from blender that we made. This is adsfjlkfsd ;kb vkjnbcnj</p><br>
      <h3>Schelule Challenges</h3>
      <p>Not all of us attend our weekly meetings. This is a big problem, because we decide on very important details in the meetings. We need to have full attendance in our meetings to be successful.</p><br>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>We are having problems getting work done, and this leads to conflict. So, we are splitting up the work and everyone can pull their part. However, we  </p>

      <h3>Tech Challenges</h3>
      <p>This week, we have not done much learning of our language. Instead, we have been learning a different language. SQL is a relational database that most of our team has been working on, but this does not help our ISP. The rest of us still need to learn lua, or contribute in some way.</p><br>
      <h3>Schelule Challenges</h3>
      <p>Not all of us attend our weekly meetings. This is a big problem, because we decide on very important details in the meetings. We need to have full attendance in our meetings to be successful.</p><br>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>Conflict over the meetings happens occasionaly, and we are still figuring things out with our full group. Another conflict is that because the attendance is not at max every time, </p>
      
      <h1>9-Jan-2023</h1><br><br>
      <h3>Tech Challenges</h3>
      <p>This week, we have installed Roblox Studios, so we can now work on the project. However, I personally have not been able to work on it for a fraction of the week. In the end, I had to uninstall it and reinstall it as well. There is also the ever-looming task of becoming fluent in lua, which will take a while.</p><br>
      <h3>Schedule challenges</h3>
      <p>We have finally gotten together all as one group, and discussed what we need to work on. This has been great, but it could be nice to meet more than once a week, as there are things that could come up that could take bigger priority. We also have established weekly meetings as a group, which is good progress.</p><br>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>Some of us are in different class periods, which makes it hard to communicate, but this has partially been fixed at our weekly meetings. In addition, we only set up roles this week, so little was getting done. This was a problem, and was fixed at meetings again. There is also argument over what roles, and more detail on notes for our software engineers.</p><br><br><br>


      <h1>2-Jan-2023</h1><br><br>
      
      <h3>Tech Challenges</h3>
      <p>My ISP group and I have not all learned the coding languae, Lu. To successfuly make our ISP, we will need to learn Lu successfuly. </p><br>
      <h3>Schedule Challenges</h3>
      <p>One of our teamates, we do not know. They are in a different period, and so scheduling and talking to them will be hard. We have made plans to talk to them, but seeing as none of us have met them yet, thiswill be a consistent challenge.</p><br>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>Not being able to talk to all of our teamates in the same class period will prove a huge challenge, as we may have different ideas that we can't get across, or lack of knowledge of Lua.</p><br>
      <h3>Roles</h3><br>
      <h3>Development Engineer</h3>
      <p>A development engineer is the person who does the work on the code of the project. At the moment, one of our team members know the language better than me, but I believe I am a valuable developer that can contribute ideas and make them come to life. </p><br>
      <h3>QA Engineer</h3></br>
      <p>The Quality Assurance Engineer takes a product and makes sure there are no bugs or otherwise faulty features with it. This role would suit me very well, because I can explore things in the game code and intentionally look for bugs, something I am very good at.</p><br>
      <h3>Project Manager</h3></br>
      <p>The project manager is responsible for all the steps in a products release and making. This role would not suit me well because I cannot be in charge of so much.</p><br>
      <h3>Product Manager</h3></br>
      <p>A Product Manager is someone who sees how useful the item will be in the market, and helps the product gain more traction, and helps the project progress itself, compared to a project manager, who makes the plan for the product. I would be better at this job because I would be able to work on the product a little bit.</p><br>
      <h3>Release Engineer</h3></br>
      <p>The release engineer makes sure everything is ready to launch before the product goes live. This would not suit me as I would need to make sure everything is ready, which is not my style, and other people on the team would be better at this.</p><br>
