      <h1>HTTP and HTTPS</h1><br>
      <p>&emsp;For a long time, most websites used HTTP conntections (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). This was cheap and easy to make, and so the majority of the websites were HTTP, but in todays age, HTTPS (S for Secure) is used. HTTPS is used to secure the website against prying eyes like MITM (Man In The Middle) attacks, where data on the server could be modified. This is important because in today's age, websites that are not secure can easily be spoofed and redirected towards a different website. This can monitor any sensitive data that a user may put on a website. <br><br></p>
      <h1>How are HTTPS Connections Secure?</h1><br>
      <p>&emsp;HTTPS websites are secured by a CA: a Certificate Authority. These are "A third party who we trust has assured us that our encrypted traffic is going only to the website we intend." (Gibson, n.d.). What comes with this are cryptographical hashes, that make a complex algorithm to validate certificates, more commonly known as fingerprints. Authentic Fingerprints will change radically if there is even the slightest change.<br><br></p>
      <h1>The Fault in HTTPS</h1><br>
      <p>&emsp;The way schools, employers, churches, and others can spy on you is through HTTPS Proxy Alliances. The way this is done is by adding a Pseuda CA, a Certificate Authority trusted by other websites. Because of this, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) interception is more and more common. This is nearly impossible to stop, and the process is long and requires a breach of security and privacy. However, because fingerprints change radically if changed by even 1 bit, they are a valid way of finding interception.<br><br></p>
      <h1>False Positives and Negatives</h1><br>
      <p>&emsp;While being able to test this is great, sometimes errors occur. For example, big websites like Amazon or Google have many, many webpages, resulting in many different certificates. Because of this, false positives occur where a user may think they are being watched, but in reality they are not. False negatives can occur, too. EV (Extensive Validations) Certificates would usualy ensure that you were not being intercepted, but the Internet explorer deliberately allows these to be spoofed. On Chrome or Firefox, however, these cannot be spoofed, guaranteeing against false negatives.<br><br></p>
      <h1>Should They Watch Us?</h1><br>
      <p>&emsp;Nowadays, schools, employers, churches, and others are constantly surveying us. Should they? This is a different question. While being watched is always considered a breach of privacy, there is also the concern of security. Entities like the government and employers need to watch us to secure the safety of citizens and workers, but how much is too much? If we give them access to monitor us, they will eventually abuse the power. On the other hand, there could be a lack of security. If a compromise is to be reached, the only possible solution will limiting what and when they survey us, while giving us privacy all the while.</p><br>
