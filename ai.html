      <h1>AI Sentience</h1><br>
      <p>&emsp; First off, what exactly is AI? AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, and while AI haven't exacty gotten to the point of taking over the world, they can still do some cool stuff. AI can't actually think for itself, but it can make descisons based on what humans have done. In this sense AI are not "sentient." Since AI are created by humans, we will use them for both moral and immoral purposes. <br> </p>
      </br>
      
      <h1>How Far, Exactly, Has AI Come?</h1>
      <p><br>&emsp;At it's current state, AI can imitate humans at specific things. For example, OpenAI's DALLE-2 can generate an accurate picture from any prompt (Roose, 2022). However, this is not as extrodinary as it seems."By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat."  (Times, 2022). This is not sentience. There are others like DALLE-2 as well. AI generated text has also make rapid improvements in the past few years. Another example of AI is GPT-3. This AI can "write screenplays, compose marketing emails and develop video games." (Roose, 2022). AI can even be mistaken for humans. With AI being so complex, and yet not being "sentient," humans will utilize them for their own purposes, both good and bad.<br><br></p>
      <h1>What Will AI Be Used For?</h1><br><br>
      <p>With people already using the technology, we will surely see it in our lives. . This will lead to, as people have speculated, more automated jobs, which leads to human job loss. Jobs that require a good memory might be replaced by AI, such as jobs with law. More and more, video productions, text-based documents, and pictures will be created by AI, and with this comes the ability to fake anyone on video more perfectly. This could lead to fake news and misinformation. On social media, AI chatbots will spread propoganda from every source, confusing the already intelligible sources. Many governments already use cyber warfare to attack other counries. When AI is used to attack, it is a very serious threat to modern day society. With what humans have done before, it is only a matter of time until we misuse AI.<br><br></p>
      <h1>Will AI Be Good or Bad?</h1><br><br>
      <p>While AI is can be used to help humanity, the potential for harm outweighs the good. AI isn't likely to get to the point we see in movies and books, more likely it will destabilize entire countries and governments. If AI is a tool to be used by humans, then AI will follow humans path. AI is most likely to be taken advantage of by greedy and ignorant humans, without caring about others. Like humans, it will always fall short of perfection.<br><br></p>
